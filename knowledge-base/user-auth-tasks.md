# Authentication Implementation Progress

## 1. Authentication System Implementation

### a. Setup:

- ✅ Add Supabase Auth client
  - Added with custom ChromeStorageAdapter for proper storage handling
- ✅ Create auth state management
  - Implemented in authManager.js with comprehensive state handling
- ✅ Add auth UI components
  - Created popup UI with login/signup forms and tab switching

### b. Core Authentication Flow:

- ✅ Initial auth check on extension load
  - Implemented in background.js and content.js
- ✅ Login/signup modal implementation
  - Created in popup with proper form handling and validation
- ✅ Token management & refresh
  - Handled through Supabase client configuration
- ✅ Persistent session handling
  - Implemented using ChromeStorageAdapter

### c. API Security:

- ✅ Move Supabase client initialization to background service
  - Initialized in supabaseClient.js
- ⏳ Implement token-based request authentication
  - Partially implemented, needs testing
- ⏳ Add request interceptors for auth headers
  - To be implemented

### d. User Experience:

- ✅ Auth status indicator in popup
  - Shows logged in/out state and user email
- ✅ Login prompt for unauthenticated users
  - Implemented in popup UI
- ✅ Session persistence across browser restarts
  - Handled through ChromeStorageAdapter

## 2. Database Schema Updates

### a. User Management:

- ✅ Leverage Supabase Auth tables
  - Using default Supabase auth tables
- ❌ Add user preferences table
  - Pending implementation
- ✅ Add user subscription status table
  - Implemented with subscription_tiers and user_subscriptions tables
  - Added subscription event tracking
  - Added subscription history

### b. Access Control:

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Implemented for subscription tables
  - Users can only access their own subscription data
  - Public access to subscription tiers
- ✅ API role definitions
  - Added service role for webhook handling
  - Added authenticated role for user operations
- ✅ Access control functions
  - Added subscription verification functions
  - Added event processing functions

## 3. Extension Updates

### a. Background Service:

- ✅ Auth state management
  - Implemented in background.js
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism
  - Handled through Supabase client
- ✅ API request handling
  - Basic implementation complete
- ✅ Subscription status tracking
  - Added to background service

### b. Content Script:

- ✅ Auth-aware API requests
  - Added auth checks before operations
- ✅ Feature gating based on auth status
  - Basic implementation in place
- ⏳ Subscription-based feature gating
  - Framework in place
  - Needs tier-specific implementation

### c. Popup:

- ✅ Auth UI integration
  - Complete with login/signup forms
- ✅ Login/signup forms
  - Implemented with validation
- ✅ Account status display
  - Shows user email and basic status
- ⏳ Subscription management UI
  - Basic structure implemented
  - Needs payment flow integration

## 4. Security Implementation

### a. Token Management:

- ✅ Secure token storage
  - Implemented using ChromeStorageAdapter
- ✅ Automatic token refresh
  - Handled by Supabase client
- ✅ Token validation
  - Part of Supabase auth flow

### b. API Security:

- ✅ Remove exposed API keys
  - Using environment variables
- ⏳ Implement request signing
  - To be implemented
- ❌ Add request rate limiting
  - To be implemented

## Next Steps:

1. Complete API Security

   - Implement remaining request interceptors
   - Add request signing
   - Set up rate limiting

2. Subscription Integration

   - [ ] Add payment links to subscription tiers
   - [ ] Configure webhook endpoints
   - [ ] Test subscription flow
   - [ ] Implement feature gating based on tier

3. User Preferences

   - [ ] Create user preferences table
   - [ ] Add preferences UI to options page
   - [ ] Implement preferences sync

4. Testing

   - [ ] Comprehensive auth flow testing
   - [ ] Security testing
   - [ ] Performance testing
   - [ ] Subscription flow testing

5. UI/UX Improvements
   - [ ] Add subscription status to popup
   - [ ] Improve error messaging
   - [ ] Add loading states
   - [ ] Implement offline support

Legend:

- ✅ Completed
- ⏳ Partially Complete/In Progress
- ❌ Not Started

## Implementation Notes
